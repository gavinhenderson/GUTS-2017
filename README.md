## Lights Out
Lights out is an assymettric game designed to test your cooperative skills with your partner. Navigate the maze and avoid the guards to get to the exit. One person cant see one person can, thats the challenge.

## Technology used
We used nodejs on the backend and socket.io to control the 'rooms' system used to have multiple games going on at once. Client side we used the p5js to do all the drawing to the screen.
