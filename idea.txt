Discussion notes:
2 players
2D and 3D?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?! Tony thinks this is stupid
"3D renders in 2D" - Gavin
"everythings rendered in 2D" - Tony
Final decision: 2D
Whats the top down - hancker and theif story - hacker breaking via hacking
into building
theif is doing the robbin
map dark unless you have that room - maze like
only vision in that room
No longer using Unity 
Using P5JS- like using processing but in a web browser
need 2d collison!! everything else drawing on screen
and web server - web sockets - "coordiating the co-ordinates" - lovely statement by antony
okay..... so lets the games BEGIN
